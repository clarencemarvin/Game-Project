# Game-Project
Python is used to create a variety of minigames. Beginning with well-known games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and progressing to lesser-known games like n-Queen. Following are the game's rules:

Tic-Tac-Toe

In order to play the game, two participants alternately place an X or an O on each square of an input-defined, n-by-n grid. The victor is the player who arranges three of their tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

Notakto

Notakto is an alternative to tic-tac-toe. Board A, board B, and board C are the three 3 Ã— 3 playing areas. Two individuals exist: Player 1 and Player 2. Player 1 begins each game. Each performs the identical piece: X Each participant takes a turn placing an X on a vacant board space. (a space not already occupied by an X). If there are three Xs in a succession, column, or diagonal, the board is dead and cannot be played on. The player who made the last move loses the game when all the boards contain three Xs in a row, column, or diagonal.

n-Queen

The N-queen game was inspired by the Eight Queens Puzzle. Users determine the area of the board. A solution necessitates that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Initially, the user will be prompted for the value of n. Following this, the user will input the coordinates of the n queens. If no queens are assaulting one another, SUCCESS is displayed. FAIL if two kings are engaged in combat.

Connect Four

Connect Four is a connection game in which two players alternate placing discs into a (6 x 7) board, that is, 6 rows by 7 columns. The pieces descend straight down, occupying the lowest space available in the column. The goal of the game is to be the first player to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

Happy playing!
